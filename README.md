In this repo I have created Transparent Restaurant Backend REST api. All endpoints including bonusses has been implemented. URLs, HTTP methods and
parameters are same with the task in Gist for all endpoints.


To test the api put the data in "data.json" (default content of file is the dataset in Gist task) and run  API.py file . Server will start in http://localhost:8080
